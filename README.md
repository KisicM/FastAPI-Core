## Features

- FastAPI-based web application with a core structure.
- Easily extensible and customizable.
- Example API endpoints for reference.
- Pre-configured for common tasks like database connection, authentication, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7+
- [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
- [Virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) (recommended)
- Docker

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd FastAPI-Core
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```sh
   pip install -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the FastAPI application, use the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

You can access the application in your web browser by visiting [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `app/` - Contains your FastAPI application code.
- `tests/` - Unit tests for your application.
- `requirements.txt` - List of project dependencies.
- `README.md` - This file.

You can customize the project structure as needed for your application.
